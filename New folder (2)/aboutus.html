The University has incredible collections of books, manuscripts and other materials, many of them housed in beautiful, historic buildings. These resources draw scholars to the University from all over the world.It's a major British and European centre for the arts, science, technology and innovation, and a fantastic place to live and study. For centuries, scholars, artists, writers, scientists and film-makers have found inspiration in Oxford's spectacular architecture—the city's famous 'dreaming spires'.</marquee></center>
